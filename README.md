# Brew-master

A (currently small) project that I am using to learn how to develop with web apps Java on the backend using Spring Boot, Hibernate, and MySQL. Frontend will likely end up being made with some modern JS framework. \
 \
Ideally, this project will serve as the backend for a future web applications that will allow users to review the craft beers that they drink, and view data coming from other users. As I learn more, things will definitely change.

## Current Project Status
* Connects to local MySQL Database and returns empty DB table 'beer' through GET endpoint /brewdata/all
* Can POST Beer objects to database through url /brewdata/addbeer
* Can GET single Beer object through url /brewdata/onebeer by passing id in encoded url (ie. /brewdata/addbeer?id=1)
* Must have gradle installed. Must have JDK 1.8 or newer. Use command ./gradlew bootRun to run.
* You can add values to 'beer' table manually via MySQL shell, but POST's are not yet functional. To be continued.

## Use Cases / User Stories

* As a contributor to this database, I want to share the info on my beer to a database to be collected and used in the future.
 
* As a contributor to this database, I want to remove OR edit beer info that I have posted in the past in the case that I have made mistakes.

* As a user, I want to view some data about a beer that has been added, OR view all data about all beers that have been added.



## Database Structuring

A simple and singular table is being used for the time being. See and comment on it here, if you'd like:
