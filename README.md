# Brew-master

A (currently small) project that I am using to learn how to develop with web apps Java on the backend using Spring Boot, Hibernate, and MySQL. Frontend will likely end up being made with some modern JS framework. \
 \
Ideally, this project will serve as the backend for a future web applications that will allow users to review the craft beers that they drink, and view data coming from other users. As I learn more, things will definitely change.

## Current Project Status
* Connects to local MySQL Database and returns empty DB table 'beer' through the url: http://localhost:8080/brewdata/all
* Must have gradle installed. Must have JDK 1.8 or newer. Use command ./gradlew to run.
* You can add values to 'beer' table manually via MySQL shell, but POST's are not yet functional. To be continued.

## Use Cases

* As a beer reviewer/user, I want to share my opinion on a craft beer to a database. \
 
* As a beer reviewer/user, I want to remove OR edit reviews that I have posted in the past in the case that I have changed my opinions.  


* As a user, I want to view some data about a beer that has been reviewed, OR view all data about all beers that have been reviewed.
